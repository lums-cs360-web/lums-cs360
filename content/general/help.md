# Communication Expectations

Ask questions well before Assignment due dates. Although you have nothing to lose by trying, realize that while the course staff try to provide as much support as possible, they are not obliged to answer last-minute questions (i.e., those within less than 2 business days from the assignment due date). 

Please be polite, courteous, and professional. Follow the [online etiquette guidelines]({attach}online_etiquette_guidelines.pdf).

We will not tolerate harassment, bullying, threats, intimidation, insults, lying, or creating any kind of environment that might discourage participation. Plagiarism, cheating, and lying are also violations of university policies, and will be subject to sanctions.

# Discussion Forum

**Questions related to the course and course material, especially if the answer could help another student!**

🚀 Posting to the discussion forum (slack) increases your changes of a **quick response** since any of the course staff or your classmates are able to answer. 🌠

Unless your question is personal (E.g., you are feeling unwell and require an EA, you have a question about your mark), all questions should be posted on the Discussion Forum first. Please do not share code from your implementations (configuration settings are OK). 

* Do not post your code. 
    * Configuration settings are OK.
* Do not post your solutions.
* Post only questions related to **this course**.
* Be polite, this is not a complaint forum.
* Follow the [online etiquette guidelines]({attach}online_etiquette_guidelines.pdf).

# Labs Office Hours

* You can get help **during the labs!**
* You can attend the **office hours of a TA.**
* You can attend the office hours of your instructor.

If your question is related to implementation/configuration issues in the projects/assignments, the TAs are best suited to help you. You can attend TA office hours remotely. **TAs do not provide help outside of Labs and Scheduled Office Hours.**

If your question is related to content covered in class, and you need further explanation, please post on the discussion forum.

TAs are not allowed to change your marks. If you disagree with your marks, [contact instructor](#contact-instructor) instead.

## Instructor Office Hours

* <span style="font-size: 200%">🔗</span> [Instructor office hours]({filename}/general/outline.md#contact-information) are in the course outline.
<!-- * Do not email instructor, use the [Contact instructor form](#contact-instructor), instead. -->

## TAs

**If you need help with your projects/assignment code, or help to get something working, the TAs are best suited to help you.**

* You can attend TA office hours remotely.
* **Do not email TAs,** unless you're having a hard time joining their Zoom/Meet.
* TAs do not provide help outside of Labs and Scheduled Office Hours.
* Please be polite and courteous.
* TAs will not re-grade your work or deal with extensions, excuses, illness, etc.

<!-- <span style="font-size: 200%">🔗</span> [TA office hours are on the eClass.](https://eclass.srv.ualberta.ca/mod/page/view.php?id=8129757) -->

# Contact Instructor

<!--<span style="font-size: 200%">🔗</span> Do not email the instructor. Use the [contact instructor form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMcgrLR4nCgfK1qJW9P5sDJp3-sTnQ9hKC94H7wojdaPaTjw/viewform?usp=sf_link).  -->

If you email the instructor about an issue that doesn't fit on the canvas discussion forum, you must include CS360 at the start of the subject line for the email. Any email without CS360 at the front of the subject line will likely be immediately lost.

Replies may take several days because there are hundreds of students. Currently, there are more than 250 students. If you are asking about something that isn't due yet (before due date) please ask a TA instead, or use the discussion forum. You might not get a response before the due date. You will not get an extension, even if the instructor does not reply before the due date.

# Wellness Supports

Here are a few key places to connect with resources:

## Student Self-Care Guide

This [Self-Care Guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t5fqgXCG369tt5hDxrzQuvlTdy2W46RB/view?usp=sharing), originally designed by the Faculty of Native Studies, has broader application for use during students’ learning. It provides some ideas and strategies to consider that can help navigate emotionally challenging or triggering material.

## 🤝 Get involved, make friends, and thrive! 🤝

Building a strong social network can greatly benefit your mental health.

# Where to NOT get help

<p class="warning">Do not ask for help on sites such as Discord, Telegram, WeChat, Snapchat... Ask on the <a href="#discussion-forum">Discussion Forum</a> instead! Or ask a TA!</p>

The only official communications are:

* Outlook
* Slack

The instructor/TA are not responsible for and completely disown any unofficial communications.
